# Visual Elements
- Dystopian image of the Singapore skyline as the player approaches the tower, should be a wide image so that it can be scrolled (with parallax effects).
- Exterior of the tower, menacing and modern-looking
- Interior of the tower, with its walls and rotting corpses of dead bodies which failed to survive the Tower's tests

# Obstacles
- Spikes, which decreases the health of the player and visually injures him
- Ghosts of failed students
- Rolling boulders
- Crushing walls (in 3D) which attempts to knock the player out of the plane of the game
- Microwave beams, which causes instant death when player enters its ray

# Audio Elements
- Background noise
- Sound effect of damage taken by player
- Loss of life sound
- Eerie sound of ghosts
