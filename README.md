# Timeline
Week 1: Base of the game
- Window and camera
- Collisions between main player and ground
- Main player (with healthbar, lives, points)

Week 2: Obstacles
- Spikes, which decreases the health of the player and visually injures him
- Ghosts of failed students
- Rolling boulders
- Crushing walls (in 3D) which attempts to knock the player out of the plane of the game
Note: Focus only on the functionality of the game for now.

Week 3: Design
- Refine the looks of the player, obstacles and background
- Compose soundtrack for the background
- Add sound effects for movement, damage and atmosphere
- Create horror and story elements to increase interest in the game

Week 4: Levels
- Design all the levels of the game, ensuring increasing difficulty

# Visual Elements
- Dystopian image of the Singapore skyline as the player approaches the tower, should be a wide image so that it can be scrolled (with parallax effects).
- Exterior of the tower, menacing and modern-looking
- Interior of the tower, with its walls and rotting corpses of dead bodies which failed to survive the Tower's tests
